## Annotation

Modern recommender systems also make heavy use of deep learning — both discriminative and generative models. A system has to understand content (tracks, products, videos, etc.), model user behavior (short- and long-term preferences), and predict which content each user is likely to enjoy. At the same time, recommender systems come with their own challenges: cold start for new items and users, huge billion-scale item catalogs with heavy-tailed popularity distributions (popularity bias), and constant distribution drift, where all the underlying distributions keep changing along with the rest of the world. 

We will discuss: 
- Two-tower neural networks for candidate generation;
- Sequential recommendation and more modern approaches to generative modeling of users; 
- Semantic IDs and tuning LLMs for recommendation;
- What makes the recommendation domain different from other deep learning domains.
