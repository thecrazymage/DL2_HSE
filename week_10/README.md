## Annotation

This lecture and seminar will discuss how diffusion models can be used for 3D computer vision tasks such as generation and reconstruction, and how they relate to methods like NeRF and Gaussian splatting. We will also look at how these models can be applied to problems like novel view synthesis, relighting, and camera pose or depth estimation.
