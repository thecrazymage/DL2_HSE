## Annotation

**Lecture:**  
This week, we'll explore the evolution of object detection and segmentation â€” from R-CNN to real-time methods like YOLO-World and CLIP-based approaches. We'll examine how U-Net architectures have transcended computer vision to power neural operators and how to use diffusion models for segmentation tasks.

**Seminar:**  
We will implement architectures and train a semantic segmentation model. We will discuss regularization methods for convolutional layers. In addition, we will learn how to use pre-trained models and apply them.
