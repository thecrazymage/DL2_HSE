## Annotation

**Lecture:**  
This lecture presents applied aspects of diffusion models, a class of generative methods that have demonstrated strong performance across images, text, and audio. We will review modern architectures, with a focus on [FLUX](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux), and unpack the key principles of their design and training.

**Seminar:**  
The seminar will provide a hands-on, in-depth inspection of [PixArt model](https://github.com/PixArt-alpha/PixArt-alpha). Then ee will attempt further fine-tuning via [DreamBooth](https://dreambooth.github.io/), review common evaluation metrics, and compare different models and configurations.
