## Annotation

**Lecture:**  
This week, we will discuss LLMs. We will discuss why they are so effective for text generation, how they can be applied to different NLP problems, and the risks they pose. You will learn the details of RLHF, PEFT, and RAG, which make LLMs robust in various cases.

**Seminar:**  
In this seminar, we will explore the concept of LLM-based agents and how they extend the capabilities of modern language models. We will discuss function calling as a way to integrate external tools, chain-of-thought reasoning for structured problem solving, and reinforcement learning techniques for training agents.
