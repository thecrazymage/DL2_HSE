## Annotation

**Lecture:**  
We'll talk about DL and tabular data. We'll go from [California](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html) to $10М [seed rounds](https://www.eu-startups.com/2025/02/prior-labs-raises-e9-million-for-foundation-models-for-spreadsheets-and-databases/). I plan to give a broad outlook on the field, trace how it evolved and talk a bit about where it's heading. We'll talk about DL model components specific to tabular data, some speculations and intuitions on why those methods may work, and finish off with a talk about foundation models for tabular data.

**Seminar:**  
Hands-on tabular DL — on a MacBook. The idea: implement some of the core models from scratch (or watch me do it). The hardware constraint might help us appreciate the practical limits (or lack thereof).
