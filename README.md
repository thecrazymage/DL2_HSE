# Deep Learning 2 HSE

This repo contains lectures slides, seminars notebooks and homeworks for the "Deep Learning 2" course at the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://cs.hse.ru/en/) of [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/). 

Details about the course organization can be found at
the [wiki page](http://wiki.cs.hse.ru/%D0%93%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_2_2025) (in Russian).

## General information

1. The course provides **5 homework assignments** and **1 competition**.
2. Evaluation formula (arithmetic rounding):
    - Applied Mathematics and Information Science: 
    $$S = \text{round}\left(0.25\cdot\text{Competition} + 0.75\cdot\frac{1}{5}\cdot\sum_{i=1}^{5}\text{HW}_i\right).$$
    - Computing and Data Science: 
    $$S = \text{round}\left(\frac{1}{5}\sum_{i=1}^{5}HW_i\right).$$
